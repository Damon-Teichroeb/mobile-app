For this submission I used Node.js + React and Cordova to launch app on an android phone I was also using Windows 11.
I wasn't able to complete this test on time so the application does not fully function.
I didn't quite get Cordova to work with the app either so I wasn unable to test it on a mobile device.

The only functionality of the app is to see a list of two contacts and their inforrmation. The buttons do not work.

to run the app:
    1 you have to have both Node.js and React installed on your computer.
    2 uncompress the zip file.
    3 open up the mobile-app folder in command prompt or powershell and type the command: "npm start".
    4 your default browser should open up to the app.
